# Joint Intent/Slot Classification with Onnx and TensorRT
Joint Intent/Slot Classification for Jetson Nano, TX1/TX2, Xavier NX, and AGX Xavier.

The Joint Intent/Slot Classification was trained with NeMo and deployed with both onnxruntime and TensorRT for optimized performance.
All computation is performed using the onboard GPU.
